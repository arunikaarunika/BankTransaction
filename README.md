🏦 BANKING SYSTEM

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW :

The Banking System is a Java-based application developed to simulate core banking operations such as account management, balance enquiry, and fund transfers. The system follows a layered architecture (Bean – DAO – Service) and interacts with a relational database to store and retrieve account and transaction details.
It is designed to demonstrate real-world banking logic, database connectivity using JDBC, and structured object-oriented programming practices. The project emphasizes modular design, maintainability, and proper separation of concerns.

✨ FEATURES :

✔ Account validation and management

✔ Balance enquiry

✔ Money transfer between accounts

✔ Transaction ID generation using database sequence

✔ Update and maintain account balances

✔ Store transfer/transaction history

✔ Custom exception handling for insufficient funds

✔ Layered architecture (DAO – Service – Bean structure)

☕ Java – Core programming language

🔗 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – Database interaction

🗄 Oracle / SQL Database – Data storage for accounts and transactions

📦 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Encapsulation, Abstraction, Modular design

⚠ Exception Handling – Custom exceptions for validation and fund checks

💻 JDK (Java Development Kit) – Compilation and execution environment
